# Modify/comment the following lines if you wish to modify
# the paths of the image files, ISO files, step files or qemu binaries.
# If you keep these lines commented, all mentioned paths are expected
# to be found in the KVM test dir (tests/kvm/).
# On the example below:
# * qemu and qemu-img are expected to be found under /usr/bin/qemu-kvm and
#   /usr/bin/qemu-img respectively.
# * All image files are expected under /tmp/kvm_autotest_root/images/
# * All iso files are expected under /tmp/kvm_autotest_root/isos/
# * All step files are expected under /tmp/kvm_autotest_root/steps/
#qemu_binary = /usr/bin/qemu-kvm
#qemu_img_binary = /usr/bin/qemu-img
#image_name.* ?<= /tmp/kvm_autotest_root/
#cdrom.* ?<= /tmp/kvm_autotest_root/
#steps ?<= /tmp/kvm_autotest_root/

# You will notice that in all test definition blocks we have 'only qemu-kvm'
# set. This means that qemu-kvm command line syntax will be used. If you
# intend to test qemu upstream, you'll have to change that to 'only qemu'.
