Make test.py detect for source of a test at same version as current package,
if not, run test.setup()
  (APW: i belive this is done?  MJB?)

Make sure build process dumps config errors in separate file from build
errors (and warnings), from build output

kernbench results are a mess - clean them up to dump into correct dirs.

Make test wrapper chdir before and after setup and execute phases - nappy change

Fix lmbench's config stage stuff

Redirect stdout and stderr for each test's setup and execute to 4 sep files
  (APW: ok, not clear i really like them (out/err) being separated.
   the loss of chronology is bad IMHO)

make profilers/cat take either a single file or list of files, autoswitching

Caching version of kernelexpand to grab new kernels
